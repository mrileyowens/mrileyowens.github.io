				<!--<p style="font-size: 2rem; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">Coming soon!</p>-->

				<p>On Wednesday, the 22nd of July, 1942, my great uncle Finley Owens joined the United States Army in Cincinnati. The National Weather Service logs the day as reaching a balmy 85<sup>o</sup>F in the Cincinnati area<sup><a href="https://www.weather.gov/wrh/Climate?wfo=iln">1</a></sup>.</p>

				<!--<p>Finley was born in 1920 to his father Everett Theodore Owens, himself a veteran of the Great War, and mother Leonia Florence Wilson. At the time Finley enlisted, his youngest brother, Luther Owens, my grandfather, was just a few years old. It is difficult to understate how turbulent the world had already been at his young age. The United States had entered its greatest economic crisis yet, democracy globally was crumbling from a wave of fascist takeovers, and a new great war had broken out, hardly 20 years after the prior, hoped to have been so terrible that it could never happen again.</p>

				<p>I have no memory of Finley. I don't know if he was just a kid swept up by a national fervor of patriotism, hoping to emulate his father, or if he was quivering in his boots.</p>

				<p>What I do know is that, regardless of his motivation or character, he stood up during a very uncertain time. It is easy to reflect on historical events with hindsight bias; that the way history unfolded was inevitable. But in mid-1942, it was not clear what the outcome of the war would be. Nazi Germany and Japan had rolled over most of Europe and the Pacific.</p>

				<p>I admire Finley's story because it deeply informs my personal relationship with fear, sacrifice, love, and the great American experiment. From the time I understood the failures of American democracy, I was sure I would jump ship and call one of the more 'enlightened' European countries home. But as my horizons broadened; as I visited new places and met new people, it was obvious that nowhere else felt like home.</p>

				<p>I am under no delusion that </p>-->

				<p>In 1942, Cincinnati was a changing city. Although Cincinnati Union Terminal, the city's first and current union passenger intercity rail station, had opened less than a decade prior, cars were increasingly becoming a staple of the city's transportation network. Gas stations (or 'filling stations' as they were contemporaneously called) and surface parking lots were already knocking down dense housing and commercial spaces. Sheltered parking pads could now be found tucked between buildings in the city's alleys. Significant infrastructure projects catering to convenient automobile travel, like Columbia Parkway and the Western Hills Viaduct, had been finished in the last decade. Major thoroughfares were now choked with traffic that slowed streetcars and endangered pedestrians.</p>

				<p>Although rationing imposed by the war temporarily halted the advance of the automobile, these changes foreshadowed the clear-cutting, highway construction, and destruction of public transportation that would follow in the post-war period.</p>

				<p>This project is dedicated to building the best possible picture of Cincinnati as Finley would have seen it in 1942.</p>

				<p>Modern American society often stereotypes Americans of yesteryear as uniquely titanic in their civic engagement, their confidence in the great American experiment, and their monuments to civic infrastructure, industry, and science. To a great extent, I believe this is true. As early as 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville noted:</p>

				<blockquote cite="https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/805328.html">
					Americans of all ages, all conditions, all minds constantly unite. Not only do they have commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but they also have a thousand other kinds: religious, moral, grave, futile, very general and very particular, immense and very small; Americans use associations to give fêtes, to found seminaries, to build inns, to raise churches, to distribute books, to send missionaries to the antipodes; in this manner they create hospitals, prisons, schools. Finally, if it is a question of bringing to light a truth or developing a sentiment with the support of a great example, they associate. Everywhere that, at the head of a new undertaking, you see the government in France and a great lord in England, count on it that you will perceive an association in the United States.
				</blockquote>

				<p>It should be comforting to know, however, that even they were making blunders we are still struggling to undo. For example, take the surface parking lot between the 1400 blocks of Walnut and Vine Street. The eastern portion of that lot was demolished into a surface parking lot sometime before 1934. Except for the building at 1415 Walnut Street. For at least 90 years, it has stood there, alone, like a headstone for the homes, shops, and community that used to be there. We have the opportunity to build something more aspirational than has existed there for more than 90 years. If we cannot even find hope in our opportunity to improve upon the legacy of Americans we often consider exceptional, then where will we?</p>
