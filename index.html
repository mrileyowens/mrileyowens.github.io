																to describe the Aegean when storms made it turbulent and choppy. He may not have
																meant it as a literal description of its color, but after seeing it myself,
																I think its rich blue tone also deserves the epithet <i>wine-dark</i>. Seeing
																the sea from so many places across the world has made me appreciate its vastness.
																When I gaze over the sea now, it is sobering to think about all the people I met
																and places I saw that are still somewhere across it, continuing on in spite of
																my absence.

																left so early that Nikos, the hotel keeper, asked me the day before to leave the keys inside the 
																main entrance and simply close the door as I left. Since I left early, I finished checking out (i.e.,
																paying him, since he insisted that I shouldn't pay him until I left) the day before. After handing
																him the notes, he hurried off to get me change. After handing me the change, he kneeled down behind
																the counter, and I was shocked to see him gleefully reveal two shot glasses and a bottle of raki,
																a popular Cretan spirit (also called tsikoudia, but not the same as the Turkish spirit raki). I
																happily accepted his kind gesture. This was also the first time I ever took a shot. Raki is a very
																strong drink, but fortunately for me also surprisingly smooth and sweet. Nikos wasted no time 
																offering me another shot, but I kindly declined, and before I could say anything, he was stuffing 
																my hands with Greek sweet gummy treats before I returned to my room. In a comedic twist, my only
																other hospitality experience even remotely comparable to Nikos's kindness was with a group of 
																Turks in Morgantown. But that's a story for a different picture. That night, I wrote a small note 
																to Nikos that I left in the room when I departed the following morning. In it, I thanked him for his
																overwhelming kindness he had shown me during my stay and described that I had never felt so welcome 
																so far from home. I hope he got my note, and I hope that he is well.

																were missing a passenger before we left the conference center, but it turned 
																out they just stayed somewhere in Kolymvari and the shuttle driver knew to 
																pick them up from there. We must've had some miscommunication with the driver.

															</div>
															<p class="caption">Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), the worst part of my journey was my return home. We landed in
																the United States (flying through Newark again), and everything went horribly. A series of flight delays and cancelations
																followed, and the best flight option left the next morning. Surprisingly, the airline's app made it very easy to reschedule 
																flights in the event of delays or cancelations. This picture is the line at the airline's service desk after they canceled 
																the last flight home that night. We waited more than an hour in line, and the ire of the would-be passengers was palpable. 
																Incidentally, I met a US veteran in line with us that had been stationed in Crete. I think he said it was sometime during 
																the 1980s or 1990s. He told me about how they shot missiles into the sea. By the time we talked to a service agent, we 
																found out the airline would not offer any lodging for the night because poor weather was responsible for the flight 
																cancelations. Originally, a gate agent told us the first flight was canceled due to a staffing shortage. I secretly 
																wonder if some corporate representative made the decision to lie about the cause so the airline wouldn't owe the 
																passengers anything. Either way, I pitied the service agents who had to receive all the fury of the irritated passengers 
																for decisions and policies they probably didn't make. All the nearby lodging we could find was full, likely from the crush 
																of passengers on canceled planes, so we made the tough decision to sleep rough in the airport. By this point, I had been 
																awake for more than a day. The only silver lining of this awful experience was Keunho. I had never navigated 
																such a tumultuous flight experience before, and I cannot imagine how much worse it would have been to experience it 
																alone.</p>
