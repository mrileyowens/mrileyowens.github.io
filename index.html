										<p>My primary research interest is how individual star-forming regions 
											regulate the production and escape of hydrogen-ionizing photons (commonly 
											just ionizing photons or the Lyman continuum (LyC)). This is important to 
											understand because it has significant implications for cosmic reionization 
											(z ~ 6–10), wherein the first generations of stars and active galactic nuclei 
											(AGN) ionized the intergalactic medium (IGM). The relative contribution of 
											stars versus AGN, the role of massive, luminous galaxies versus light, 
											faint ones, and the time evolution of both dichotomies remain unclear.</p>
											
										<p>Directly studying galaxies during reionization is difficult. The galaxies 
											are extremely distant and generally faint, and the increasingly opaque 
											IGM as near as z > 2 typically makes it impossible to directly observe 
											their LyC photons. This means estimates of LyC escape for reionization 
											galaxies must generally rely on proxies for LyC escape like rest-ultraviolet 
											(UV) colors, dust content, ionization state, etc., which do not always
											have a clear relation to LyC escape. And although the angular diameter 
											evolution is favorable to reionization galaxies, they are typically 
											unresolved, preventing spatially resolved analyses of their interiors, 
											which is critical to understand LyC production and escape methods.</p>

										<p>Studying nearby galaxies instead is promising because many are spatially
											resolved, but they become unresolved by z=0.1, and they are not necessarily 
											fair comparisons to reionization galaxies, typically requiring criteria 
											to select for galaxies analogous to reionization galaxies. These criteria 
											can suffer from biases. Their LyC is also totally inaccessible to ground-based 
											instruments, and the only state-of-the-art instrument that can access their 
											LyC is the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, 
											which has an on-sky aperture far too large to constrain LyC escape to 
											individual regions of a galaxy, and often a limited wavelength coverage 
											below the Lyman limit.</p>

										<p>My work uses high-redshift, gravitationally lensed galaxies at cosmic noon 
											(z ~ 1–3) to offer an optimal middle ground between directly studing 
											reionization and studying local galaxies. These galaxies offer many advantages. 
											They are much closer in time to reionization, so we expect them to generally 
											be more comparable to reionization galaxies. Their foreground lenses magnify 
											their light by as much as tens or hundreds of times, and increase the 
											angular size of the galaxy, routinely permitting the resolution of individual 
											star-forming regions, and in extreme cases, individual stars. At these 
											redshifts, the LyC from these galaxies is directly accessible with the sharp 
											imaging of optical instruments on HST, and the rest-UV through rest-optical 
											is well-captured by optical and near-infrared instruments on ground-based 
											telescopes, offering a complementary wealth of spectral diagnostics constraining
											outflows, gas conditions, stellar populations, and much more. This combination 
											is a powerful tool to characterize the environments that leak LyC photons. 
											I combine sharp space-based lens modeling from my collaborators with the 
											rest-UV signatures of outflows, nebular emission, and neutral gas morphology 
											to characterize the ISM as it relates to the escape of LyC photons.</p>

										<p>My primary research interest is how the smallest physical mechanisms in galaxies
											regulate the production and escape of hydrogen-ionizing photons (commonly just
											ionizing photons or the Lyman continuum (LyC)). This is important to understand
											because it has significant implications for cosmic reionization, an ancient 
											cosmological epoch wherein the first generations of ionizing sources ionized 
											most of the universe. The relative contribution of different types of ionizing
											sources and their contribution's time dependence is still unclear.</p>

										<p>Directly studying galaxies during reionization (remember: light has a speed limit, 
											so that we observe galaxies how they appeared when they first emitted their light 
											arriving to us) is difficult. Not only are the galaxies extremely distant and often 
											faint, but it is typically impossible to directly observe their ionizing photons. 
											They were mostly spent ionizing the universe. This makes it difficult to predict from 
											their observable characteristics how many ionizing photons they produce and emit.
											Additionally, these galaxies are typically unresolved on the sky, meaning we
											can't see their internal structure to understand how internal mechanics of a 
											galaxy affects its ionizing photon production and escape. Galaxies are busy 
											places made with many building blocks interacting in complex manners, meaning
											it is critical to peer into galactic interiors to robustly understand galaxies.</p>

										<p>That wasn't very encouraging to hear. So what else can we do?</p>
										
										<p>Owing to their proximity, nearby galaxies are excellent choices to scrutinize 
											physical processes in galaxies in detail. They are large on the sky, and modern 
											telescopes can easily make out their tiny features and shape. But for these
											galaxies, it is impossible to detect their ionizing photons with ground-based
											telescopes since the Earth's atmosphere absorbs their ionizing photons. Space-based
											telescopes can circumvent this, but apart from space-based telescopes being more 
											difficult to build, deploy, and operate, ultraviolet detectors are technically 
											challenging to construct, which can severely limit the wavelength range of 
											ionizing photons they can detect, and their ability to distinguish small
											details on the sky. Furthermore, nearby galaxies are often much more evolved
											than galaxies from reionization, making a direct comparison an 'apples to oranges'
											one. Just studying nearby galaxies thought to be analogous to those from
											reionization can help resolve this, but this is still subject to possible
											biases of what <i>we think</i> makes nearby galaxies analogous to galaxies 
											during reionization.</p>

										<p>My work uses distant, gravitationally lensed galaxies to offer an optimal middle ground 
											between directly studing reionization and studying local galaxies. The largest
											assemblies of mass in the universe, galaxy clusters, can magnify the light from
											galaxies behind them by tens or hundreds of times, and also 'zoom in' on 
											background galaxies, so that they appear much larger on the sky than they 
											otherwise would. In this manner, it is often possible to study the interiors of
											lensed galaxies. The great distance to these lensed galaxies also causes a 
											redshift of their light due to the expansion history of the universe. This
											means that their light stretches to longer wavelengths as it travels to us.
											This redshift is strong enough for these galaxies that it is feasible to observe
											their ionizing photons with optical detectors that offer excellent image quality
											and wavelength coverage. Because these galaxies are so distant, they can make
											fairer comparisons to galaxies during reionization, since we see them separated
											by much less time. I combine the superior image quality of space-based
											telescopes with ground-based spectroscopy, and use the two to pin down the tiny
											mechanics that make galaxies leak ionizing photons.</p>

																paying him, since he insisted that I shouldn't pay him until I left) the day before. After handing
																him the notes, he hurried off to get me change. After handing me the change, he kneeled down behind
																the counter, and I was shocked to see him gleefully reveal two shot glasses and a bottle of raki,
																a popular Cretan spirit (also called tsikoudia, but not the same as the Turkish spirit raki). I
																happily accepted his kind gesture. This was also the first time I ever took a shot. Raki is a very
																strong drink, but fortunately for me also surprisingly smooth and sweet. Nikos wasted no time

																my hands with Greek sweet gummy treats before I returned to my room. In a comedic twist, my only
																other hospitality experience even remotely comparable to Nikos's kindness was with a group of 
																Turks in Morgantown. But that's a story for a different picture. That night, I wrote a small note 
																to Nikos that I left in the room when I departed the following morning. In it, I thanked him for his

																Incidentally, I met a US veteran in line with us that had been stationed in Crete. I think he said it was sometime during 
																the 1980s or 1990s. He told me about how they shot missiles into the sea. By the time we talked to a service agent, we 
																found out the airline would not offer any lodging for the night because poor weather was responsible for the flight 
																cancelations. Originally, a gate agent told us the first flight was canceled due to a staffing shortage. I secretly 
																wonder if some corporate representative made the decision to lie about the cause so the airline wouldn't owe the 
																passengers anything. Either way, I pitied the service agents who had to receive all the fury of the irritated passengers 
																for decisions and policies they probably didn't make. All the nearby lodging we could find was full, likely from the crush 
																of passengers on canceled planes, so we made the tough decision to sleep rough in the airport. By this point, I had been 
																awake for more than a day. The only silver lining of this awful experience was Keunho. I had never navigated
