					<p>My primary research interest is how individual star-forming regions 
						regulate the production and escape of hydrogen-ionizing photons (commonly 
						just ionizing photons or the Lyman continuum (LyC)). This is important to 
						understand because it has significant implications for cosmic reionization 
						(z ~ 6–10), wherein the first generations of stars and active galactic nuclei 
						(AGN) ionized the intergalactic medium (IGM). The relative contribution of 
						stars versus AGN, the role of massive, luminous galaxies versus light, 
						faint ones, and the time evolution of both dichotomies remain unclear.</p>
							
					<p>Directly studying galaxies during reionization is difficult. The galaxies 
						are extremely distant and generally faint, and the increasingly opaque 
						IGM as near as z > 2 typically makes it impossible to directly observe 
						their LyC photons. This means estimates of LyC escape for reionization 
						galaxies must generally rely on proxies for LyC escape like rest-ultraviolet 
						(UV) colors, dust content, ionization state, etc., which do not always
						have a clear relation to LyC escape. And although the angular diameter 
						evolution is favorable to reionization galaxies, they are typically 
						unresolved, preventing spatially resolved analyses of their interiors, 
						which is critical to understand LyC production and escape methods.</p>

					<p>Studying nearby galaxies instead is promising because many are spatially
						resolved, but they become unresolved by z=0.1, and they are not necessarily 
						fair comparisons to reionization galaxies, typically requiring criteria 
						to select for galaxies analogous to reionization galaxies. These criteria 
						can suffer from biases. Their LyC is also totally inaccessible to ground-based 
						instruments, and the only state-of-the-art instrument that can access their 
						LyC is the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, 
						which has an on-sky aperture far too large to constrain LyC escape to 
						individual regions of a galaxy, and often a limited wavelength coverage 
						below the Lyman limit.</p>

					<p>My work uses high-redshift, gravitationally lensed galaxies at cosmic noon 
						(z ~ 1–3) to offer an optimal middle ground between directly studying 
						reionization and studying local galaxies. These galaxies offer many advantages. 
						They are much closer in time to reionization, so we expect them to generally 
						be more comparable to reionization galaxies. Their foreground lenses magnify 
						their light by as much as tens or hundreds of times, and increase the 
						angular size of the galaxy, routinely permitting the resolution of individual 
						star-forming regions, and in extreme cases, individual stars. At these 
						redshifts, the LyC from these galaxies is directly accessible with the sharp 
						imaging of optical instruments on HST, and the rest-UV through rest-optical 
						is well-captured by optical and near-infrared instruments on ground-based 
						telescopes, offering a complementary wealth of spectral diagnostics constraining
						outflows, gas conditions, stellar populations, and much more. This combination 
						is a powerful tool to characterize the environments that leak LyC photons. 
						I combine sharp space-based lens modeling from my collaborators with the 
						rest-UV signatures of outflows, nebular emission, and neutral gas morphology 
						to characterize the ISM as it relates to the escape of LyC photons.</p>

					<p>I primarily have experience observing the rest-ultraviolet to rest-optical wavelengths of star-forming, lensed 
						galaxies at cosmic noon and beyond. Historically, I have relied on large, ground-based optical telescopes (especially 
						Gemini and Magellan) and their optical and infrared space-based counterparts: HST and JWST.
